**Team:** Aurora Weavers
**Challenge:** [Stellar Stories: Space Weather Through the Eyes of Earthlings](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/2025/challenges/stellar-stories-space-weather-through-the-eyes-of-earthlings/) (NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025)

## Project Description

**The Sun's Secret Adventure** is an interactive mobile learning platform that transforms the complex science of space weather into an engaging and understandable story for children. Through a personalized narrative, fun animations, real-time NASA data, and gamified missions, our app demystifies concepts like solar flares, CMEs, and their effects on Earth, inspiring a new generation of informed and curious explorers.

### Project Status

The video demonstrations showcase a comprehensive and functional **prototype** of our application. The core narrative, gameplay mechanics, and data integration features are in place. The full application is currently **under development**; building out the complete library of missions and educational content is a time-intensive process that we are actively pursuing.

## The Challenge

The "Stellar Stories" challenge required us to "create a digital children's story that explains what space weather is and how it impacts people's daily lives." We aimed to go beyond a simple storybook by creating a fully interactive experience that is not only educational but also fun and directly connected to real-world science.

## Our Solution

Our solution is a mobile application that serves as a multi-faceted educational tool. We solve the problem of science accessibility by employing a three-part strategy:

1.  **Narrative-Driven Learning:** We introduce concepts through a story where the child is the hero, making learning relatable and memorable.
2.  **Live Data Integration:** We bridge the gap between lesson and reality by integrating a live dashboard of solar events using NASA's public APIs.
3.  **Gamified Application:** We reinforce knowledge through interactive missions that allow children to apply what they've learned in simulated real-world scenarios.

* **HeyGen:** Utilized for creating animated sequences and character presentations in our educational videos.
* **Evernote (AI Text to Voice) & ElevenLabs:** Employed to generate the clear and engaging voiceover narration for the prototype videos.
* **Midjourney:** Used to generate concept art and unique visual assets for characters and backgrounds.
* **RunwayML:** Assisted in video editing, applying effects, and generating dynamic B-roll footage.

### NASA Resources
* **Data:** **NASA DONKI (Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information)** API for real-time space weather alerts.
* **Visuals & Inspiration:** NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio (SVS), NASA's Image and Video Library.
* **Educational Content:** Information from `nasa.gov` and the Heliophysics division pages.

## Future Plans

* **Expanded Mission Library:** Develop new game missions based on other space weather impacts (e.g., "Power Grid Defender," "Satellite Navigator").
* **Multi-Language Support:** Localize the app to make it accessible to children globally.
* **Teacher's Dashboard:** Create a web-based portal for educators to use the app in classrooms, with lesson plans and progress tracking.
* **Augmented Reality (AR) Features:** Develop AR modules where children can visualize the Earth's magnetosphere in their own room.
